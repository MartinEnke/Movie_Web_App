SECRET KEY:

1. Generate the key
openssl rand -hex 32 > secret_key.txt
This writes your 64-char hex string into secret_key.txt.

2. Copy it into your .env
Open .env (in your project root) and add:
SECRET_KEY=<paste-the-hex-string-from-secret_key.txt>
(You only need to do this once.)
Delete or hide secret_key.txt from your project to not get uploaded again.

3. Ensure python-dotenv is installed
pip install python-dotenv
Flask’s CLI will automatically load your .env when you run flask run or python -m flask.

In your code (e.g. at the top of app.py or in create_app()):
import os
app.config['SECRET_KEY'] = os.environ['SECRET_KEY']
Restart your server with flask run (no manual export needed)—now SECRET_KEY comes from .env.


Why this matters

The SECRET_KEY is used to cryptographically sign the session cookie so that Flask can trust its contents.

It’s also what powers flash() under the hood.

You only hit that “no secret key” error now because you started
using flash() (and by extension the session) in your routes and error handlers.
Flask’s flashing system stores messages in the user’s session cookie,
and signing that cookie securely requires a SECRET_KEY. Before you called flash(),
you hadn’t touched the session at all, so Flask never needed to sign or load it and never complained.


Once you do:
flash("Something happened", "info")
Flask has to put that message into session['_flashes'], which in turn means it needs
your app’s secret key to cryptographically sign (and later verify) the session cookie.
Without app.config['SECRET_KEY'], the session is simply unavailable, hence the runtime error.

Quick recap
No flash() or session usage → No secret key needed.
Introduce flash() (or any session[...] access) → Flask must sign cookies → you must set SECRET_KEY.
So as soon as you decided to give your users feedback with flash(), you needed to configure app.config['SECRET_KEY'].


Tip for production

Generate a secure random key once (e.g. openssl rand -hex 32), set it in your environment (export SECRET_KEY=…),
and never check it into source control.
